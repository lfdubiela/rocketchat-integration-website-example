# Integration website and rocket

This is a very poor implementation of how integrate rocket chat and website without meteor framework

## Prerequisites

For that we need just a project [meteor-ddp](https://github.com/EddieFloresLive/meteor-ddp) 
```
I don't know why but for somehow when ddp fires 'change' (_changeDoc) on some collection 
watched this collection is not initialized yet, so I had to modify the meteor-ddp.js to works fine.
